# Etch-a-Sketch Project

## Welcome to Etch-a-Sketch!
Remember the joy of doodling with an Etch-a-Sketch as a kid? This is your chance to relive that experience in a modern, web-based format! With this interactive drawing tool, you can create a grid of your choice, sketch to your heart’s content, and reset whenever you like. Let your creativity flow!

## What Can You Do?
- **Create Custom Grids**: Use the "Set Grid Size" button to generate a grid. You decide the number of squares per side (up to 100).
- **Interactive Sketching**: Hover over squares to see them change color—no clicking required!
- **Stylish Design**: Clean and user-friendly interface.
- **Footer with Links**: Includes a simple footer with placeholder social media links.

## What Powers This App?
- **HTML**: Builds the structure of the page.
- **CSS**: Adds style, layout, and hover effects.
- **JavaScript**: Makes everything work behind the scenes, from grid creation to user interactions.

## How to Use It
1. **Launch the App**:
   - Open the `index.html` file in any web browser.

2. **Set Your Grid Size**:
   - Click the "Set Grid Size" button.
   - Enter a number between 1 and 100 when prompted. This sets how many squares appear per side.
   - A brand-new grid will appear, ready for you to start sketching.

3. **Get Sketching**:
   - Hover over the grid squares to change their color to green.

4. **Change the Grid**:
   - Click the "Set Grid Size" button anytime to start fresh with a different grid size.

## A Quick Look Under the Hood
### HTML
- Provides a structure that includes a description, a grid container, a button for resetting the grid, and a footer for extra information.

### CSS
- **Page Layout**: Clean, centered, and easy to navigate.
- **Button Design**: Buttons are styled to look modern and include hover effects for interactivity.
- **Grid and Squares**: The grid automatically adjusts its layout based on your input, with hover effects for sketching.
- **Footer**: A simple footer with placeholder links to social media.

### JavaScript
- **Dynamic Grid Creation**:
  - Clears the existing grid.
  - Dynamically creates grid squares based on the user’s input.
  - Calculates square dimensions so the grid fits neatly into the container.
- **Input Validation**:
  - Ensures users enter a number between 1 and 100.
- **Hover Interaction**:
  - Squares change color when hovered over, creating the sketching effect.

## Try It Out!
- Open the app and see a default 16x16 grid.
- Click "Set Grid Size" and enter a number, say `10`. Enjoy your new 10x10 grid!
- Hover over the squares to start drawing. Simple, fun, and no mess to clean up.

## Footer Details
The footer keeps it simple with:
- A copyright notice for Thynk IT.
- Links for Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram (placeholders for now).

## What’s Next?
Here are some ideas for future enhancements:
- **Color Picker**: Let users choose their drawing color.
- **Eraser Tool**: Add a way to erase individual squares.
- **Save Feature**: Enable saving your sketch as an image.
- **Mobile-Friendly Design**: Make the app work better on phones and tablets.
